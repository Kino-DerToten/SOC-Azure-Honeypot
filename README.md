---

## Introduction  
In this project, I built a basic home SOC in Microsoft Azure** from scratch. Using a free Azure subscription, I deployed a Windows VM honeypot, exposed it to the internet, and ingested its logs into Azure Log Analytics Workspace. I then integrated Microsoft Sentinel to analyze real-world attack traffic and visualize malicious activity.  

This project demonstrates Log analysis, Threat detection, and SOC operations in a real-world cloud environment.

## Project Steps  

### 1. Azure Resource Setup  
- Created a Windows Virtual Machine (honeypot).  
- Configured networking to allow inbound RDP traffic, exposing the VM to attackers.

### 2. Log Analytics Workspace (LAW)  
- Centralized all log data into LAW.  
- Connected the VM‚Äôs security logs for collection and monitoring.

**Basic KQL LAW Overview (LAW)**

**Advanced KQL LAW Overview (LAW)**

---

### 3. Microsoft Sentinel Integration  
- Linked Sentinel with LAW.  
- Built detection rules for failed login attempts.  
- Queried logs with **KQL (Kusto Query Language)**.

**Watchlist Creation Overview**

---

### 4. Attack Analysis & Visualization  
- Queried failed RDP logins targeting the honeypot.  
- Identified IP sources and geolocations.  
- Built a **Sentinel attack map** to visualize attacker origins in real-time.  

**Attack Map Overview (Microsoft Sentinel)**

## Key Findings  
- Exposed systems are immediately targeted by brute-force attacks.  
- Sentinel provides real-time visibility into malicious activity.  
- KQL queries are critical for filtering and investigating security events.  
- Hardening measures (firewalls, NSGs, IP restrictions) drastically reduce alerts.  

---

## Skills Gained  
- üîπ Configuring Azure + Microsoft Sentinel for SOC monitoring  
- üîπ Centralizing logs with Log Analytics Workspace  
- üîπ Writing and executing KQL queries  
- üîπ Building attack maps and threat visualizations  
- üîπ Applying defensive security controls in Azure  

---

## Conclusion  
This lab provided hands-on SOC experience in a cloud environment. By intentionally exposing a honeypot VM, I was able to capture real attacker traffic, investigate it using Sentinel, and validate the effectiveness of security hardening techniques.  

This project highlights practical skills in:  
- **Threat detection**  
- **Log analysis**  
- **SOC monitoring workflows**  
- **Cloud security engineering**
