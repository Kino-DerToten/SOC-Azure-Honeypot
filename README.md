# üõ°Ô∏è Azure Honeypot SOC Project


---

## Introduction  
In this project, I built a **basic home SOC in Microsoft Azure** from scratch. Using a free Azure subscription, I deployed a **Windows VM honeypot**, exposed it to the internet, and ingested its logs into **Azure Log Analytics Workspace**. I then integrated **Microsoft Sentinel** to analyze real-world attack traffic and visualize malicious activity.  

This project demonstrates **log analysis, threat detection, and SOC operations** in a real-world cloud environment.

## Project Steps  

### 1. Azure Resource Setup  
- Created a Windows Virtual Machine (honeypot).  
- Configured networking to allow inbound RDP traffic, exposing the VM to attackers.

### 2. Log Analytics Workspace (LAW)  
- Centralized all log data into LAW.  
- Connected the VM‚Äôs security logs for collection and monitoring.  

---

### 3. Microsoft Sentinel Integration  
- Linked Sentinel with LAW.  
- Built detection rules for failed login attempts.  
- Queried logs with **KQL (Kusto Query Language)**.  

---

### 4. Attack Analysis & Visualization  
- Queried failed RDP logins targeting the honeypot.  
- Identified IP sources and geolocations.  
- Built a **Sentinel attack map** to visualize attacker origins in real-time.

## Key Findings  
- Exposed systems are **immediately targeted** by brute-force attacks.  
- Sentinel provides **real-time visibility** into malicious activity.  
- KQL queries are critical for filtering and investigating security events.  
- Hardening measures (firewalls, NSGs, IP restrictions) drastically reduce alerts.

## Skills Gained  
- üîπ Configuring **Azure + Microsoft Sentinel** for SOC monitoring  
- üîπ Centralizing logs with **Log Analytics Workspace**  
- üîπ Writing and executing **KQL queries**  
- üîπ Building attack maps and threat visualizations  
- üîπ Applying **defensive security controls** in Azure

## Conclusion  
This lab provided hands-on SOC experience in a cloud environment. By intentionally exposing a honeypot VM, I was able to capture **real attacker traffic**, investigate it using Sentinel, and validate the effectiveness of **security hardening techniques**.  

This project highlights practical skills in:  
- **Threat detection**  
- **Log analysis**  
- **SOC monitoring workflows**  
- **Cloud security engineering**
